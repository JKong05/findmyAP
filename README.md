## What I learned
Prior to developing this application, my knowledge of full-stack development and other languages was very limited. I had finished learning the fundamentals of python and hoped to use it
in more data-oriented projects, but I had no where to start. However, creating datasets of college credit policy data and manipulating it with python was extremely insightful. Through 
trial and error, I learned about complex scraping methods, localized databases, and back-end development. This project also allowed me to use my pre-existing knowledge of the front-end
framework Bootstrap so that I could model the UI/UX off of current popularized university websites like ratemyprofessor.com or ratemydorm.com. In the future, I hope to integrate more
features such as a "list all schools" function or more thorough credit breakdowns, but am continuing to collect user review and insight from current and previous high school students.
